kubectl-fns
===========

kubectl convenience functions. Add `. <path>/{bash,zsh}rc` to your shell rc and
export KUBE_NS='your-kubectl-namespace'.

Dependencies: kubectl, percol

`kswitch` will ask kubectl what namespaces are available and let you set one as
KUBE_NS.

`k` is the kubectl replacement. It sets `-n $KUBE_NS` and adds a few command
aliases.

`kgg` (k get grep) takes a kind and regex. It `get`s the kind, greps by the
regex and returns the first column, usually the full name of the thing matching
the regex.

`kgp` is like `kgg` but instead of taking a regex, it asks you to pick via
percol.

`kre` is like `k`, but uses `kgg`. Useful to abbreviate EG pod names: `kre desc
po comm`.

`kex` will try to find a pod matching the given regex and open a shell there,
or you can specify a command. `--` is already included, don't add it again.

`ksql` is basically `kex postgres psql`.
